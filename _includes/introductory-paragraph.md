Hello, and welcome to one of my homes on the web! I'm Petar, a Research Scientist at [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com).
I have a PhD in Computer Science from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk) ([Trinity College](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk)), obtained under the supervision of [Pietro Li√≤](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/~pl219).
My research interests involve devising neural network architectures that operate on nontrivially structured data (such as graphs), and their applications in algorithmic reasoning and computational biology. 
In particular, I am the first author of [Graph Attention Networks](http://petar-v.com/GAT/)---a popular convolutional layer for graphs---and [Deep Graph Infomax](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rklz9iAcKQ)---a scalable local/global unsupervised learning pipeline for graphs.
My research has been featured in media outlets such as [ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-brain-microsoft-plumb-the-mysteries-of-networks-with-ai/).
