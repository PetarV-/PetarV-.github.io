I believe that proper and timely communication and dissemination of research results is equally important to conducting core research activities. Hence, I am highly active as a **communicator**---organising _workshops_ on graph representation learning at major machine learning conferences, giving _invited talks_ at various venues (both for research audiences and the general public), and writing _blog posts_ and _tutorials_. More to come!
