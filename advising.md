Besides research and communication, I am an enthusiastic **advisor** and **educator** (primarily for machine learning, but I'm occasionally trying to expand into other areas of computer science and mathematics).

> _The best way to understand something is to explain it to somebody else._

Guided by this quote, I have readily taken up teaching, lecturing and advising throughout my PhD, and am still keen to advise interesting projects whenever they arise.

# Public policy ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¸

I've [participated](https://www.blic.rs/biznis/vesti/srbija-razvija-vestacku-inteligenciju-formirana-radna-grupa-za-izradu-strategije/zqpx50f?fbclid=IwAR2kHebLiPUFJ7C4CbdPtM5UeFD4nCnOM-SzLlxa1ngdymaK6QDIOM3n7pc) in developing [**Serbia's AI Strategy for 2020-2025**](https://www.srbija.gov.rs/tekst/en/149169/strategy-for-the-development-of-artificial-intelligence-in-the-republic-of-serbia-for-the-period-2020-2025.php), as one of the representatives of Serbian machine learning researchers working abroad. The Government of Serbia had [officially adopted it](https://www.rts.rs/page/stories/sr/story/125/drustvo/3789080/usvojena-strategija-razvoja-vestacke-inteligencije-.html?fbclid=IwAR2mJaSLFYibm_53pryM-g8JO-M0V1hrNh1inm4jqGedQViB46fHeeOgsEQ) on 26 December 2019.

The Strategy defines objectives and measures for the development of AI, whose implementation should result in economic growth, improvement of public services, advancement of scientific staff, and development of skills for the jobs of the future. Also, the implementation of the Strategy measures should ensure that AI in the Republic of Serbia is developed and implemented in a safe manner and in accordance with internationally recognised ethical principles, in order to exploit the potential of this technology to improve the quality of life of each individual and the society as a whole, as well as to achieve Sustainable Development Goals.

# Supervising

While at Cambridge, I have been extremely fortunate to (co-)supervise the project work of several students, whose dissertation titles are outlined below. Most of these disseratations have been turned into research publications, and many of the students are now working in prominent AI labs (either as doctoral students or research engineers).

## Undergraduate projects

* [Ioana Bica](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/doctoral-students/ioana-bica) (2017) **Comparative Analysis of Neural Network Architectures for Epigenetics Inference**.
* Momchil Peychev (2017) **Experimental Study on the Properties of Disentangled Autoencoders**.
* Tudor Petru Èšiplea (2017) **An end-to-end control policy system for the GameBoy platform**. _(Highly commended dissertation)_

# Lecturing

Thus far, I have held four formal lectures to undergraduate and postgraduate students. I enjoy lecturing, and would definitely be interested in further opportunities within this scope.

* [**Be nice to your neurons: Initialisation, Normalisation, Optimisation and Regularisation**](/talks/UCLS2.pdf). Introduction to Deep Learning (COMPGI23), University College London, 14 November 2017.

* [**Unsupervised methods: Diving deep into autoencoders**](/talks/UCLSlides.pdf). Introduction to Deep Learning (COMPGI23), University College London, 10 October 2017.

* [**A trip down long short-term memory lane**](/talks/LSTMslides.pdf). Research Students Lecture Series, University of Cambridge, 21 February 2017.

* [**Exactly solving TSP using the Simplex algorithm**](/talks/tsp_demo.pdf) (with [Thomas Sauerwald](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~tms41/)). Advanced Algorithms, University of Cambridge, 13 May 2016.

Furthermore, I have been in charge of designing the practical session on neural networks for the Cambridge MPhil course on Machine Learning and Algorithms for Data Mining (L42).

# Reviewer duties

I serve as reviewer for several major machine learning conferences, journals and workshops, always striving to provide the most actionable feedback possible. My efforts have been recognised at NeurIPS 2019, where I have been given a [best reviewer award](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2019/Reviewers).
